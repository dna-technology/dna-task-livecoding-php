# How should I start

## Scenario
Letâ€™s imagine you are working on API for backend of an online payment system.
The actors are: users (festival participants), merchants, event organiser.
We want to enable backoffice operations to the event organiser.

Currently implemented:

- This data can be used for reporting.

# Tasks
